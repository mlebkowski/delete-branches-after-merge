# Delete branches after merge

1. Expect the `develop` branch not to be removed after merge to `main`. We achieve this by simply adding `develop` to protected branches
2. Deleting feature branches after their code [was successfully merged](/mlebkowski/delete-branches-after-merge/pull/2)
3. The branch was succesfully removed, and can be restored with ease. Either by a click of a button, or by simply pushing from local
